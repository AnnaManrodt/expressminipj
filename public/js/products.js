/**
 * TO DO:
 * 
 * When a customer clicks on a product name they initiate code here which makes a POST request and sends in 
 * the product ID and an order for a quantity of 1 to the server.
 * 
 * The fetch path would look something like this: /api/product/<id of product>
 * 
 * In the route listener, you'll need a wildcard to catch the id of the product being ordered. You'll need to 
 * modify the products json file also to reduce the qty by one.
